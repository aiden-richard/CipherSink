# CipherSink
CipherSink is a strategic two-player naval combat game inspired by [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)), built using zero trust principals. The game is played on a peer to peer connection, needing no central server to operate. Game state is tracked using hashes and salts, ensuring every move can be verified without revealing where your ships are.

### Game Rules:
 - Game is played on a 10x10 grid
 - Each player has 5 ships: one length 5, one length 4, two length 3, and one length 2
 - Before the game starts, players place their ships on their grid
 - Players take turns targeting a cordinate on their opponent's grid
 - The opponent responds hit or miss
 - If a ship is hit on each of its cells, it is considered sinked
 - The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins
